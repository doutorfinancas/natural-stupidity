# Implementation Plan: Natural Stupidity Project

This document outlines the high-level implementation plan for the Natural Stupidity project.

## Phases

1. Project Initialization
   - Initialize Git repository and Go module
   - Configure folder structure (`api`, `service`, `repository`, etc.)
   - Setup environment variables (`.env.example`)
   - Create Dockerfile and local development Docker Compose
   - Integrate Air for live reload

2. Database Design
   - Define MySQL schema for core entities:
     - Users
     - Roles
     - Teams
     - Directions
     - Vacations
   - Implement GORM models and relationships
   - Setup migrations (GORM AutoMigrate)

3. Core Service and Repository Layers
   - Implement repository interfaces and GORM-based implementations
   - Implement service interfaces containing business logic
   - Register dependencies via Uber Dig

4. API Layer
   - Define HTTP request and response structs (`api/request`, `api/response`)
   - Implement Gin handlers and routes
   - Add Swagger annotations and generate docs

5. Authentication and Authorization
   - Implement JWT-based authentication
   - Middleware for role-based access control

6. User Profiles and Administration
   - CRUD operations for user profiles
   - File upload for profile pictures
   - Admin endpoints for managing users and roles

7. Hierarchical Entity Management
   - Teams and their leaders
   - Directions and sub-directors
   - Board hierarchy and reporting relationships

8. Calendar and Time Off
   - Booking vacations and sick days
   - Validate weekdays and exclude holidays
   - Hierarchical views for time-off reporting

9. Testing and Quality Assurance
   - Unit tests (table-driven) for services and repositories
   - Integration tests using Dockerized MySQL
   - Linting (`go vet`) and formatting (`gofmt`)

10. Deployment
    - Build and tag Docker images
    - Setup CI/CD pipelines
    - Deploy to Kubernetes or AWS

11. Documentation and Observability
    - Generate Swagger UI
    - Structured logging and metrics
    - Trace IDs for request tracing

12. Future Enhancements
    - Feature toggles
    - Audit logging
